Hii! Team Alpha2 this is the Readme.md file that contains all of the required steps for setup your enviorment for our project CropCare Ai

note- If you have already setup your environment and clone repository from github, you need to follow the instructions from 5th step onwards.

This will also install npm (Node Package Manager)

2. Install Visual Studio Code

3. Create a new React project

Open a terminal or command prompt
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project
Run the following command to create a new React project:
